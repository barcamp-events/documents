# Hello everybody!
Welcome to the second update of 2019 for BarCamp Events! We've got some exciting stuff to share: BarCamp Omaha updates (including the groovy design!), exciting "day of" happenings at BarCamp Omaha, the BarCamp app updates, and our new sponsors and backers. Let's get into it!

# BarCamp Omaha
BarCamp Omaha is happening November 9th, at Kaneko. Buy your tickets here: https://www.eventbrite.com/e/barcamp-omaha-2019-tickets-66366823957

#### Leading up to the event
A few exciting things have happened since our last update - BarCamp Omaha 2019's branding went live - Thanks to the bones! Check out their redesigned site: https://www.thebonesco.com

The theme for 2019 is friendship - because without our friends in our community, BarCamp Omaha may not have come back.

Thanks to Bergman Incentives, a Gold Sponsor, we're going to have some colorful friendship bracelets for all attendees (or until we run out - then I'll make yours myself!)

I sent the check for Kaneko this morning! WHEW! I also sent about half of my planned sponsorship emails, so I have more on that front to do. Also, I have sent many people their Eventbrite code to buy their free tickets, and I'll have another round of those going out quite soon!

Speaking of ticket sales, we've sold 25 tickets since our last update!

I'm staying late today to prep a site for 2019. I want to have the design ready by this weekend, that would be pretty awesome.

But, why not relive what brought us here? When all the barcamp material was transferred to me, I also received the past sites. So, here it is, your moment of zen - all of the BarCamp Omaha sites since 2014:

#### Day of Updates
A few fun things: I'm setting up a place where my partner, Gabriella Parsons (https://www.gabriellaparsons.com/), is going to have an area set up at BarCamp Omaha where she will be interviewing attendees. Aside from that, I have a few more things being cooked up that I'll share in the next update! I'll be giving one talk about the direction I'm taking BarCamp Omaha and how you can organize or art direct any event. More to come - this coming month is all about "day-of"

# BarCamp Events
I'm going to reiterate this until everybody knows: BarCamp Events is the tent-pole organization that will help us continue putting on BarCamp Omaha effectively, as well as (hopefully!) other BarCamp's in the area and beyond. Tangentially, the BarCamp Event's app helps people organize their own BarCamp-like event.


#### Design
BarCamp Events finally has a settled design language, which might only make minor shifts as everything is settling in. Check it out! The wavelengths behind are a quick and dirty representation of the sound of multiple talks given at onces - definitely a very barcamp day-of type vibe! It's not perfect, but it's what it needs to be, so that's great.

#### App Progress
I'm working on the app a bit or a lot every day. You can check out the progress by going here: https://beta.barcamp.events. This app will be usable before BarCamp Omaha, and it's here that we'll put together the schedule for the day of the event. I'll be sending out invites to folks at least a couple weeks before November 9th. It's already quite feature filled - you can sign up, in, out, create events, add/remove sponsors, tracks, and talks to/from events. I would say, conservatively, it's about 20% done and I'll have people run through using it when it's at about 50% or so. The parts that are missing are the entire "hosting" experience, and the scheduler itself.

#### 501(c)(3)
This is on my agenda this month, I've done some preliminary work and I want to get this by the end of the year for BarCamp Events. There's not much else to share, but I wouldn't be doing my job if I didn't share this progress. Hopefully I will have more progress on this front in our next update.
